/*
    ToDo:
        *   Section should be a wrapper that takes any listItem components as children
            *   Section header should also include a newList button; shows on open
            *   This way, new lists can be easily submitted and attached to a given section
        *   ListItem should display an individual item, as well as have an intuitive UI
            *   Allows users to edit, delete, mark as done etc.
