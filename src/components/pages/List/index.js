// Hardest part so far is modeling data, drawing out a form to see what it will look like
// Is this an opportunity to use cool UI for drawing in data?
// Data flow would be something like
    // Name of list
    // Sections (with a what is this drop down for those who don't understand)
    // Labels (with a what is this drop down for those who don't understand)
    // ListItems
// The above will be created from the dashboard page
